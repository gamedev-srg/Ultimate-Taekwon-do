## Formal elemnts



### 1. Players

* This game is inteded for players of all ages, as difficuly level can be adjusted according to the player's skill. This game has a shallow learning curve, meaning players can easily jump in the action without having to learn and practice for a long time
* The game is inteded for 1-2 Players, depending if the player is against an npc or another player
* The interaction between players is competitve

### 2. Objectives

* In duels, the main objective is to have more health than the enemy player once the timer runs out
* In Patterns the main objective is to achieve a higher score by choosing the right moves quicker than your opponent
* Players will be introduced to the main objective via a combination of tools (Intro level + Widely accpeted game concepts as HP bars and score)
* As for the moment, players will not have the option to choose different objectives.

### 3. Procedures


* The game's first moments will throw the player right in the middle of an Duel intro level, Scripted moves by an npc will allow the game time to teach the core game mechanics without the player becoming frustrated, whilst also giving the player the satisfaction of winning a fight (A simillar example can be seen in Amazon's New World intro level)
* The core game loop consists of winning matches to increase skill level, allowing you to unlock harder levels, so on and so forth. Winning matches will grant coins, which players can use to unlock cosmetics (if implemented) 
* To finish the game (Finish a match) a player must complete the above objectives.

The game's mechanics are simple, so every player can have an easy time to grasp and understand them. The game will introduce it's mechanics via an intro level(for duels).
Once the player decides to try patterns for the first time, and intro level will be played there too.
actions are performed using the keyboard In Duels, or (mouse OR keyboard) in Patterns.

### 4. Rules

* Rules which restrict the players actions are ones that either reduce his HP (such as getting hit or stepping out of the arena bounds), or ones that reduce, or don't increase his score (Performing the wrong movment in patterns)
* Rules are pre-determined, the player cannot change them. the ruleset is simple and widely accepted as the standarad for such games.
* The player will learn rules via visual cues, such as seeing his or the enemy's HP bar go down, Or seeing your points go down (or up)


### 5. Resources

* In duels, resources are HP and stamina. in Patterns, resource is score.
* HP is what determines who wins, and stamina allowes players to perform attacks. without stamina a player cannot attack, leaving him in a disadvantage.
In patterns, The player with the highest score wins.
* Players cannot regain HP. they can regain stamina by playing tactically, not wearing themselves out. Players gain score by performing the correct abillity, and quickly.
* Since HP is limited, is rare. Stamina isn't rare per-say, but it is expended by abillites, which players will have to use to win the game. Score isn't rare, but a player must be better than his opponent to gain a higher score.
* Visual cues will inform the player of the resources(HP and stamina bars, scoure counter)

### 6. Conflicts

* This is a lesser-conflict, it is not the main conflict players will face, but the players must deal with the game's stamina,timer,and arena-bounds system.
* Main game conflict is between oponnents, fighting them in both game modes to have more HP, or have a higher score.
* The player must manage the stamina resource, and remember the order of movments in a pattern.


### 7. Bounds

* Closed world, bounds in duels are the arena's out-of-bounds edge. In patterns the player cannot perfrom movement actions.
*  Flat world. not circular

 The game will show the player he is near the arena's edge via visual cues(different color for the edge) If the player reaches the out-of-bounds edge, he will be blocked by a wall or something simillar, to show he cannot move further.

The duels' map is very simple and intuitive, often times a different color for the border represents the edge of the arena. The map is also a crucial part of the game's rules, if a player steps out of it's bounds, he is damaged.


### 8. Outcome

* The game has 3 possible outcomes. A player can either win or lose. in unlikely scenario where players will have an equal amount of HP once the timer ends, the game will end in a draw.
* The outcome isn't related to luck as there is nothing random about the game. it's mainly about skill. The only place where luck can be a factor is if you happen upon a Pattern you don't rememeber, but yet, it's about skill.
* The game has a zero-sum outcome.

## Market research

Simillar game: Dojang 
 https://taekwondo.en.uptodown.com/android
 
* ![Screenshot (13)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74140353/138919875-3b3e5231-3d8e-4162-9c9e-3e0e71b4fd0a.png)

* Despite looking simillar, Dojang doesn't implement the arena-bounds, system. having Score in duels instead of HP lessens the effect of attacks, as players are more likely to feel satisfaction from seeing the enemy's HP decrease once they are attacked, rather then seeing their score go up. Also, Dojang doesn't have the Patterns game mode.

 Simillar game: True Taekwondo 
 https://www.truetaekwondo.net/

 * Same concepts as before - point based system in addition to having bad controls and bad repsonse time, i'm sure our game will stand out.
 * Likewise with the addition of Patterns.
 
The implementaion of the out-of-bounds system, with the addition of Patterns, and moves related to Taekwon-do will make the game stand out.
 
 These are the only 2 relavent games I found about Taekwon-do. the 3rd I found was a game released in '84 only in Japan and Korea. so its not relavent today, or here.
