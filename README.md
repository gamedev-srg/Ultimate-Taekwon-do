# Ultimate-Taekwon-do

Hello!
Ultimate Taekwon-do is a game based on the Korean martial art.
In the game you can face off against opponnents in duels or patterns.
If you choose to duel, you and your enemy will strive to reduce the other's HP to 0, or as low as you can get it before the match ends, but make sure you watch your stamina and your footing! You do not want to step out of the arena!
If you chose to perform a pattern, a series of movments will be displayed on screen, you have to remember them! Select the correct movment to perform as fast as you can before the timer ends, but be quick! Quicker players win more points!
